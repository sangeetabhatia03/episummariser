The goal of episummariser is to calculate key measures of outbreak
intensity and duration. Some of the measures of interest are: \*
probability of occurrence of an epidemic, \* time of epidemic peak, \*
time to extinction, \* attack rate, \* timing to geographic spread, \*
proportion of spatial units affected at the end of the outbreak.
